## **Planning Ability**

##### Maximum Difficulty Solved (MDS)

MDS measures a player's **planning** ability, namely, their ability to **think through sequential, logical steps** and **deduce the appropriate current course of action.**

MDS is computed from the **number of stages in the player was able to clear in the puzzle (closed-ended) task sequence.**

For example, completing 5/11 puzzle stages will result in an MDS score of 5, while completing all 11/11 stages will result in an MDS score of 11.

The maximum MDS score possible is **11**.

The average MDS score based on previous studies is **8-9**.

Players with lower MDS scores completed fewer puzzle stages than average, and may have struggled with understanding what was required to solve the task at hand.

Planning is classically measured through Tower of Hanoi and similar sequential logic puzzles. In ARC-M, the stages are presented sequentially in increasing difficulty and players are given XX amount of time to complete as many puzzles as they can.

MDS was significantly correlated with [One-Touch Stockings (OTS) of Cambridge](https://cambridgecognition.com/one-touch-stockings-of-cambridge-ots/), a digitial task based on the Tower of London psychometric task (a variant of Tower of Hanoi), and also showed correlation with Conners 3 EF.
