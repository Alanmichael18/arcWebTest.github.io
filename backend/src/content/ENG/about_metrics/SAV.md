## **Working Memory**

##### Score Attack Verbosity (SAV)

SAV measures a player's **working memory**, namely, their ability to **encode and store temporary chunks of information** and **appropriately access it later for usage.**

SAV is computed from the **number of pieces the player placed on the stage within a single “EXEC” run during the open task sequence.**

If the player had multiple “EXEC” runs, the maximum was taken. It does not account for piece placement during the closed task sequence. For example, if a player places 3 pieces in one “EXEC” and then edits their board to put 2 more pieces (for a total of 5 pieces), the player will receive an SAV score of 5.

The average SAV score based on previous studies is **3.67.**

Players with lower SAV scores may not be able to hold as many chunks of information in their brain, and struggle with creating more complicated, piece-abundant configurations in the open task. They may tend to forget items or events in daily life.

Working memory is classically measured by card-flipping and letter-number memorization tasks. In ARC-M, players' working memory is measured based on how they are able to memorize the spatial location and purpose of the pieces they put down.

Previously, SAV was found to be significantly correlated with the number of mistakes in the [Spatial Working Memory task (SWM)](https://cambridgecognition.com/spatial-working-memory-swm/), a task in which players are instructed to efficiently search for tokens in a random assortment of boxes, remembering where tokens had been previously found across rounds.
