## **Inhibitory Control**

##### Score Attack Deliberation (SAD)

SAD measures a player's **inhibitory control**, namely, their ability to **withhold action until the proper timing, even when they have a strong impulse to take the action anyway.**

SAD is computed from the **number of seconds the player took to perform their first “EXEC” in the open task sequence.** It does not account for whether that try was successful or whether any pieces were placed in the intervening time.

For example, performing the first “EXEC” after 3.0 seconds will result in an SAD score of 3.0, and an SAD score of 4.2 means the player waited 4.2 seconds to perform their first “EXEC”.

The average SAD score based on previous studies is **5.37**.

Players with lower SAD scores may have a tendency to try things more impulsively rather than after careful planning, which may be beneficial in scenarios where one must try new things, but can also lead to dangerous and risky behaviors.

Inhibitory control is classically measured through tasks like the Stop Signal Task (SST) in which players have to override learned impulses to withhold behavior. In the SST, players were trained to press a button as soon as a signal appeared, and then in the latter half told to withhold action if a tone sounds.

Previously, SAD was found to be significantly correlated with [Stop-Signal Task (SST)](https://cambridgecognition.com/stop-signal-task-sst/).
