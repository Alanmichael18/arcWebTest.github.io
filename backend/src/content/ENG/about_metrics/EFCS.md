## **Executive Function**

##### Executive Function Composite Score (EFCS)

EFCS is a composite of a player's MDS and TACR scores, and broadly measures a player's **executive function**. It indicates the player’s ability to **plan for complex, multi-step, novel tasks** and **appropriately regulate their behavior.**

EFCS is computed directly from the average of the MDS and TACR z-scores of the player, that is: **EFCS = (zMDS + zTACR) / 2.** Note that zEFCS ≠ EFCS.

The average EFCS score in previous studies was **0.08.**

Executive functions are a set of cognitive processes necessary to achieve goals. Scoring low in executive function may indicate that the player struggles with navigating more complex tasks, which can result in problems in daily life.

In study 1, EFCS was significantly correlated with Conners 3 Executive Functioning Sub-scale (a measure of real-life EF problems associated with ADHD).
