## **Strategic Thinking**

##### Score Attack Record (SAR)

SAR measures a player's **strategic thinking,** namely, their **ability to abstractly come up with “best approaches” to a relatively open-ended task or need.**

SAR is computed from the highest score attained during the open task sequence.

The score in the open task sequence is calculated as follows:

*   X points for each wooden box cleared.
*   Y points for each silver box cleared.
*   Z points for each gold box cleared.

The maximum SAR score possible is **XX**.

The average SAR score based on previous studies is **9.92**.

Players with lower SAR scores may have struggled to deduce how exactly to approach or solve problems with little outline or guidance.

Previously, SAR was found to be significantly correlated with the “Strategy” sub-metric of the [Spatial Working Memory task (SWM)](https://cambridgecognition.com/spatial-working-memory-swm/), looking at the number of times the player started their search from a set box across rounds (to ostensibly minimize working memory load compared to a completely random walk approach).

Note: The SWM tasks is a task in which players are instructed to efficiently search for tokens in a random assortment of boxes, remembering where tokens had been previously found across rounds.
