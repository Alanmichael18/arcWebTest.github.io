## **Adaptability/Set Shifting**

##### Task-Appropriate Coordinate Repeat (TACR)

TACR measures a player's ability to **set shift** or **adapt**. That is, **how easily they are able to recognize and appropriately adapt their behavior to changing circumstances and rules.**

High TACR Score Playstyle Example / Low TACR Score Playstyle Example

The **coordinate repeat metric (z-CR)** takes the largest number of times the player visited any given coordinate during a single execution sequence and scales it based on comparisons to the z-CR scores of other players in the same stage.

For the open task, a higher z-CR is rewarded as it generally results in higher scores. On the other hand, with the closed puzzle sequence, there is no incentive in over-complication.

**TACR** is computed by **comparing the average z-CR between the open task and closed task to gauge whether the player is capable of adjusting their behavior** (i.e. complicating a route if there is incentive) **in accordance with changes in rule sets.**

For example, as shown above, a player with a higher TACR may more easily realize the shift in rule sets and adjust their route to maximize points (by breaking boxes) instead. On the other hand, a player with low TACR may not realize the set shift, and thus prioritize reaching the goal (as in the closed puzzle task).

A low TACR score falls within the range **\[score range\].**

An average TACR score falls within the range **\[score range\].**

A high TACR score falls within the range **\[score range\].**

Set shifting/adaptability is classically measured through tasks like the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, in which there is an unspoken shift in rules and kids are tasked with recognizing when the rule has changed to appropriately change their card sorting.

Similarly in ARC-M, the switch between the closed puzzle task and open task is not explicitly stated, but relied on the player's ability to recognize a change in rule sets, and measures a player's ability/extent in which they are able to adjust.

Previously there has been no CANTAB analogue for TACR. TACR was significantly correlated with Conners 3 EF.
